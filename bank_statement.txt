How it works

Dispute Resolution

If you have a problem with your agreement, please
 try to resolve it with us in the first instance. If you
 are not happy with the way in which we handled
 your complaint or the result, you may be able to
 complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. If
 you do not take up your problem with us first you
 will not be entitled to complain to the Ombudsman.
 We can provide details of how to contact the
 Ombudsman.

Important information about
 compensation arrangements

We are covered by the Financial Services
 Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The FSCS can pay
 compensation to depositors if a bank is unable to
 meet its financial obligations. Most depositors –
including most individuals and businesses – are
 covered by the scheme. We will issue the FSCS
 information sheet and exclusions list which set out
 in detail what is, and is not, covered by the FSCS,
 once a calendar year usually with your account
 statement.

For further information about the compensation
 provided by the FSCS, refer to the FSCS website at
www.FSCS.org.uk.

Using your Barclays debit card - what 
costs and what doesn’t

If you use your debit card in the UK  Barclays will not 
charge you for using your debit card in the UK when 
making purchases, making a cash withdrawal, or 
when buying travellers’ cheques or foreign currency. A 
small number of ATM providers may charge a 
transaction fee but they should tell you about this 
on-screen before you commit to any transaction.

If you use your debit card abroad or make a debit 
card payment in a foreign currency (either abroad or 
in the UK) we'll charge you a 2.99% Non-Sterling 
Transaction Fee when making purchases, making a 
cash withdrawal, or when being refunded.  This fee 
also applies whenever you do not pay in sterling, for 
example shopping online at a non-UK website.  This 
rate does not apply to Travel Wallet transactions.
 As we explain in our customer terms, we calculate our 
exchange rate using the reference exchange rate for 
the Visa card scheme.  In most circumstances, Visa 
converts transactions into sterling using the Visa 
Exchange Rate on the day the transaction is 
authorised.  However for a small number of 
transactions the conversion may happen on the day 
the transaction is processed. As this may be a day or 
two later, the exchange rate may be different on that 
day. 
You'll find a comparison of our exchange rate for 
certain currencies as a mark-up against the rate 
published by the European Central Bank in the 
Barclays App or at the following website: 
https://www.barclays.co.uk/travel/using-debit-card-
abroad/ This is updated twice a day. This may help 
you to decide whether you want to accept the 

conversion rate offered by the retailer or ATM provider 
or accept our rate.

Transferring money between countries

If you need to transfer money between countries, you
 may be asked for your SWIFTBIC (Bank Identification
 Code) and IBAN (International Bank Account
 Number).  These are on the front of your statement
 and you’ll need them so that international banks can
 identify your account correctly. Full details are on:
business.barclays.co.uk/bb/iban

How we pay interest

If your account pays interest and is in credit, we work
 out your interest on the balance of your account at the
 close of business every day. Interest is calculated on
 the statement balance or the cleared balance,
 depending on the type of account you have. Where
 credit interest rate(s) are shown on your statement,
 these are current at the time of printing the statement
 and may have changed during the statement period.
 Unless we say otherwise, any interest rates we show
 are gross annual rates.
 If you are a UK taxpayer you may have to pay tax on
 interest earned in excess of your Personal Savings
 Allowance (with the exception of interest earned on
 ISAs, which continue to be free from UK tax for eligible
 customers). For information and guidance please refer
 to HMRC’s website
www.gov.uk/hmrc/savingsallowance.
 The management of your tax affairs is your
 responsibility, including making any required
 declarations to HMRC.

If you use your overdraft Facility

If your account is overdrawn, and you don’t pay off
 the full amount you owe, any credits paid into your
 account will reduce any balance in excess of your
 arranged overdraft facility first, and then your
 payments will go towards repayment of your
 overdraft.

 To help you understand the charges associated with
 using your arranged overdraft, you can visit
Barclays.co.uk/youroverdraft or ask for a copy of ‘Our
 Bank charges explained’ in branch. You can also tailor
 the alerts you receive, which can help you stay in
 control and on top of your finances.

Getting information from Barclays

We send information to customers with their
 statements about relevant new offers and products,
 and about how to get the best from their existing
 Barclays accounts. If you don’t get these messages
 and you’d like to, or if you do and you’d rather you
 didn’t, you can call 0345 7 345 345, go to
barclays.co.uk, or come into a branch. And if you
 change your mind at any time, just get in touch.
